    <p>Social media refers to digital platforms that enable users to create, share, and engage with content in real time. These platforms have transformed communication, marketing, and entertainment.</p>
    
    <p>Some of the most widely used social media platforms include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), TikTok, LinkedIn, and Snapchat. Each platform serves different purposes, from personal networking to professional growth and entertainment.</p>
    
    <p>Social media has had a profound impact on various aspects of life. It has revolutionized communication by allowing people to stay connected globally. Businesses use social media for branding, advertising, and customer engagement. Additionally, these platforms provide a vast source of entertainment, including videos, memes, and live-streamed events. Social media also plays a crucial role in spreading news and raising awareness about important social issues.</p>
