    <h3>1. Earthquakes</h3>
    <p>Earthquakes occur when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, causing the ground to shake. They can lead to massive destruction and tsunamis.An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the Earth's surface caused by the release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere. This energy release occurs due to the movement of tectonic plates, volcanic activity, or human-induced activities. Earthquakes vary in intensity, ranging from minor tremors to catastrophic events that cause widespread destruction and loss of life.

       <br> <br>The primary cause of earthquakes is tectonic plate movement. The Earth's crust is divided into large plates that constantly move due to convection currents in the mantle. When these plates collide, separate, or slide past each other, stress builds up and is suddenly released as seismic waves, leading to an earthquake. The major types of tectonic boundaries involved are convergent boundaries (where plates collide), divergent boundaries (where plates move apart), and transform boundaries (where plates slide past each other). In addition to tectonic activity, earthquakes can also result from volcanic eruptions, where magma movement within the Earth triggers seismic activity. Furthermore, human activities such as mining, dam construction, nuclear testing, and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) can also induce earthquakes.</p>

    <h3>2. Hurricanes</h3>
    <p>Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are powerful storms with strong winds and heavy rain, often causing flooding and damage to coastal areas.A hurricane is a massive, rotating storm system that forms over warm ocean waters and is characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and low atmospheric pressure. Also known as tropical cyclones or typhoons in different regions, hurricanes are among the most destructive natural disasters. They develop when warm, moist air rises from the ocean, creating a low-pressure system that intensifies as more air is drawn in. The Coriolis effect causes the storm to rotate, and if conditions are favorable, it strengthens into a hurricane. These storms are classified based on their wind speeds using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranges from Category 1 (74-95 mph winds) to Category 5 (157+ mph winds).<br><br> Hurricanes cause widespread destruction through strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding. The eye of the hurricane is a calm, low-pressure center, surrounded by the eyewall, where the most intense winds and rainfall occur. As the storm makes landfall, powerful winds can destroy buildings, uproot trees, and bring down power lines, while storm surges—abnormal rises in sea levels—can flood coastal areas. Prolonged rainfall often leads to flash floods and landslides, causing further devastation. The economic and human toll of hurricanes can be enormous, with loss of life, displacement of people, and billions of dollars in damages.</p>

    <h3>3. Floods</h3>
    <p>Floods happen when excessive water accumulates in an area, submerging land and causing destruction to homes, crops, and infrastructure.A flood is the overflow of water onto normally dry land, often causing widespread destruction and disruption. Floods can occur due to heavy rainfall, overflowing rivers, storm surges, melting snow, or dam failures. They are among the most common and deadly natural disasters, affecting both urban and rural areas worldwide.<br><br>There are different types of floods, including river floods, flash floods, coastal floods, and urban floods. River floods happen when excessive rainfall causes rivers to overflow. Flash floods occur suddenly due to intense rainfall in a short period, often leading to rapid water buildup. Coastal floods are caused by storm surges, hurricanes, or tsunamis, leading to the inundation of coastal areas. Urban floods occur when drainage systems fail to handle heavy rainfall, resulting in water accumulation on streets and low-lying areas.

    <h3>4. Tornadoes</h3>
    <p>Tornadoes are violent rotating columns of air that extend from a thunderstorm to the ground, causing extreme damage in their path.A tornado is a violent, rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It is one of the most destructive natural disasters, capable of causing massive damage in a short time. Tornadoes form when warm, moist air meets cold, dry air, creating instability in the atmosphere. When strong winds at different altitudes move at varying speeds and directions (wind shear), a rotating column of air can develop. If this rotation is pulled into a thunderstorm and extends downward, a tornado forms.<br><br>Tornadoes vary in strength and size, ranging from a few meters to over a kilometer wide. Their wind speeds can exceed 300 mph (480 km/h), making them extremely destructive. They are classified using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, which ranges from EF0 (weakest) to EF5 (strongest). Tornadoes are most common in the United States, especially in "Tornado Alley" (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska), but they also occur in other parts of the world, including Canada, Argentina, and Bangladesh.<br><br></p>
